                    <p>
                    Artificial technology (AI) is a great tool, nothing more, 
                    nothing less. I've used it in a great few projects; hell, 
                    it assisted in creating this website. At the time of creation, 
                    I had experience in Unity C# and JavaScript, but by no means 
                    was I then, nor am I now, a software developer, nor do I have 
                    the ambition to be. I used ChatGPT to do the key structure, 
                    nd I worked from there. If I had it to do over again, I would 
                    have done more by hand, but that's because I learned from working 
                    with AI to create the project to begin with.
                    <br><br>
                    With that said, AI should never take the place of your voice as an 
                    individual. I believe AI use is ethical only dependent on your 
                    intent as a creator. While I enjoy making and working on software, 
                    it is not my art, but sharing my cause and projects is. 
                    While some of my articles are currently AI-written, 
                    I'm going back and rewriting these to truly make them my own.
