                    Artificial technology (AI) is a great tool, nothing more, 
                    nothing less. I've used it in a great few projects; hell, 
                    it assisted in creating this website. At the time of creation, 
                    I had experience in Unity C# and JavaScript, but by no means 
                    was I then, nor am I now, a software developer, nor do I have 
                    the ambition to be. I used ChatGPT to do the key structure, 
                    and I worked from there. If I had it to do over again, I would 
                    have done more by hand, but that is only because I've now developed
                    a working knowledge of HTML and CSS. 
                    <br><br>
                    With that said, AI should never take the place of your voice as an 
                    individual. I believe AI use is ethical only dependent on your 
                    intent as a creator. While I enjoy making and working on software, 
                    it is not my art, but sharing my cause and projects is. 
                    While some of my articles are currently AI-written, 
                    I'm going back and rewriting these to truly make them my own.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite my fairly positive thoughts on the technology, 
                    it is important to consider the ecological and economic 
                    effects it has already had. These factors will only continue 
                    to worsen, so please use it with care. Consider dropping ChatGPT, 
                    Gemini, Claude, etc. in favor of self hosting. Despite the drawbacks, 
                    with self hosting you will have the benefit of knowing what happens
                    to your data.
