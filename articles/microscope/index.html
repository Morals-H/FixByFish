                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>
                    Its not uncommon that I get asked about what tools I use to work on 
                    electronics, this is my recommendation for what microscope you should 
                    get based on where you are in your electronics journey. Though he 
                    majority of your soldering work as a casual technician can be done 
                    without the assistance of any magnification. With that said its 
                    nice to have when you need it. Also note that all links are Amazon 
                    affiliate links, if you purchase one of these items through my links
                    I get a small kickback.

                    I recommend simply getting a Neiko 01902; when I was taking my 
                    IPC J-STD-001, we got to use these, and genuinely, for the price 
                    of lunch, you can't beat it. You get a 2X Zoom as well as a pair 
                    of helping hands to hold your board or wires.

                    I'd definitely say it's worth it to get a mag lamp for about 40$. 
                    It's also something I had the chance to use in my J-STD-001 
                    course, and I was surprised with how nice it was to actually 
                    work with. You get a 10X zoom and a fairly decent light that 
                    provides 1800 lumens.

                    At home, I have a Kaisi TX-350E, Which is an absolutely wonderful 
                    trinocular setup with 7X to 50X magnification. With that said for 
                    the price of 360$ thats what you'd expect. Quite literally, 
                    any soldering or any inspection you will ever need to do can be 
                    done with this absolute beast of a setup. It does seem that Kaisi 
                    is no longer offering that specific model; however, now, in it's 
                    its place, you'll find the Kaisi TX-350S. From what I can tell, 
                    it's as much of a beast as its older brother, and I would likely 
                    recommend it as much as I recommend the TX-350E.

                <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
                <p>
                    The Mechanic R75T-B1 is an fantastic scope 
                    that I used every day while I worked in a repair shop. It has a 
                    range from 7X to 45 and a wonderful ring light to illuminate anything 
                    you're working on. Honestly if I had been able to find this scope on 
                    a website I was familiar with I would have purchased it in a heartbeat 
                    instead of the Kaisi even though I have grown to love that scope.

                <h2>Less-than-Honorable Mentions</h2>
                <p>
                    the Aopick Digital Microscope. It does the job well enough that you can get 
                    away with it on most things, but many times when I've used it at my current 
                    job, I've exclaimed, "I can't see what I'm working on", because the low 
                    resolution of the camera and the lack of depth perception you get with a 
                    digital microscope. Regardless, if you want a 50$ camera microscope to 
                    maybe record a youtube video or something this'll do the job.

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Most people really don't need anything better than the mag lamp, while I love
                    having a true microscope it really isn't worth it for my home setup. Whatever 
                    you choose just make sure you get your money's worth out of it. Have fun and 
                    good luck!
