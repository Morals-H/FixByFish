                <h2>Project</h2>
                <p>Tritact is a simple turn-based board game released for Android and Windows on October 5, 2023.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>Tritact used rock-paper-scissors mechanics on a 3x3 square; each player got eight pieces. With each turn, the players could move 3 of their pieces, and then the board was compared after each player had moved; this continued until at least one player couldn't continue.</p>
                <p>The players could create their decks between rounds; they could then use this deck against a bot that chose a random deck and would do random movements. I intended to add multiplayer and started working on it.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>What Happened</h2>
                <p>The game concept would only really appeal to a niche audience; it's a very simple game with minimal graphics and can be unclear at first. Since it never found an audience, I ceased working on it; however, it's fully playable.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>I made this game the week before I moved to Cleveland; it was my last project in my hometown, so it was special. I didn't have high hopes for it, but I had an idea and went for it, and I'm content with that.</p>
