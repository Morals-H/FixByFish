                    <p>
                        Tri-tact is a turn-based tactical board game released for Android and Windows on October 5, 2023. Players compete using a 3x3 board with eight pieces each, employing rock-paper-scissors mechanics.

                    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each player could move up to three pieces per turn, after which the board was evaluated to determine outcomes. Players could create custom decks between rounds and face off against bots that selected random decks and moves. Multiplayer functionality was planned but not fully implemented.

                    <h2>Project Findings</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game appealed only to a niche audience due to its simple mechanics and minimal graphics. Since it did not find a player base, development ceased. Despite this, the game remains fully playable.

                    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tri-tact was my final project before moving to Cleveland. While modest in scope, it represents a complete idea executed independently, and I’m satisfied with what I accomplished.
