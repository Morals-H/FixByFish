                <h2>Project</h2>
                <p>
                    Tritact is a simple turn-based board game released for Android 
                    and Windows on October 5, 2023.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>Tritact used rock-paper-scissors mechanics on a 3x3 square; each player 
                    got eight pieces. With each turn, the players could move 3 of their pieces, 
                    and then the board was compared after each player had moved; this continued 
                    until at least one player couldn't continue.
                </p><p>
                    The players could create their decks between rounds; they could then use 
                    this deck against a bot that chose a random deck and would do random movements. 
                    I intended to add multiplayer and started working on it.
                </p>

                <h2>What Happened</h2>
                <p>
                    The game concept would only really appeal to a niche audience; it's a very 
                    simple game with minimal graphics and can be unclear at first. Since it never 
                    found an audience, I ceased working on it; however, it's fully playable.
                </p>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    I made this game the week before I moved to Cleveland; it was my last project 
                    in my hometown. I didn't have high hopes for it, but I had an idea and went for it, 
                    and I'm content with that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The game is playable <a href="https://shawnwolf.itch.io/tritact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
