                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've made two successful attempts to implement generative AI into the MMO 
                        (Massively Multiplayer Online) game, Graal: Online Classic. 
                        The first attempt was just to see if I could do it, but I absolutely fell 
                        in love with the concept and decided I wanted to do it right.
                        <br><br>
                        My original project, known as Echo, was written in AHK (AutoHotkey), 
                        but my implementation was finicky to say the least. Since I, at the time, 
                        was just having fun, I essentially used an OCR to capture private messages, 
                        spoke with ChatGPT in the browser, copied the response, and pasted it into 
                        the Graal public chat. While it worked, the approach was extremely simplistic. 
                        It worked fairly well, despite a few hiccups. This initial version ran from 
                        July 23 to July 28, 2024, before the account received a temporary ban due to 
                        players tricking the LLM into making racial remarks. 
                        <br><br>
                        For a few months, I went about my normal business, but an idea eventually 
                        brewed. I wanted to do an actual implementation of this project. My second 
                        attempt was known as Nyra. Nyra was far more advanced than her older sister. 
                        Nyra could dance, play Rock, Paper, Scissors, and engage in both public and 
                        private chat. Two major changes this project had over it predecesor was the 
                        change of the LLM to Qwen2 and that the program was written with Python. 
                        Nyra featured several smaller advancements as well, such as the ability to 
                        use in-game commands, retain individual conversations, and multiple layers 
                        of filtering to prevent misconduct. 
                        <br><br>
                        With the advancements, the project ran from April 25 to May 22, 2025, before 
                        inevitably being banned. This ban was due to a bad actor using the program to 
                        harass another individual. While I loved this project, I was growing burned out 
                        with reviewing logs and maintaining part of the filter system. I may one day 
                        revisit this project, but for the time being, I'll let it rest.
