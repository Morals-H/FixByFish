                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>Echo Ai was a project that aimed to allow players in the MMO Graal Online Classic to communicate fully with OpenAi's ChatGPT within the game.</p>
                <h2>The Technical Side</h2>
                <p>Echo was a fairly simple program written in AutoHotkey Version 2. The program would check for PMs, and if one were found it'd open the messages, and read both the username of the sender and the message, this information is sent to the ChatGPT, ChatGPT would then respond, and Echo would take the response and read it out in the game's open chat. Along with this Echo had a few features such as command detection, if a player attempted to force the bot to use an in-game command it'd detect and drop the message except for Graal Online Classic's built-in Rock-Paper-Scissors minigame, Echo was able to play this with players by choosing a random number which would determine its choice of either rock, paper, or scissors.</p>
                <h2>What Happened?</h2>
                <p>The Account received a warning from the Graal Online Classic administration staff simply saying "No", immediately I ceased using the program. After double-checking the Graal Online Code of Conduct, I reached out to the staff via email to ask for more context as from my understanding I was within the guidelines. I received an email in return stating "Any program used to operate an account in place of a person is prohibited.". I attempted to have a conversation but got no messages in return.</p>
