                <h2>Project</h2>
                <p>
                    Echo AI was a project that aimed to allow players in the MMO Graal Online 
                    Classic to communicate fully with OpenAI's ChatGPT within the game. Echo 
                    only ran from July 23 to July 28, 2024, before the Graal Administration Staff 
                    shut it down. Echo accumulated thousands of messages from hundreds of unique 
                    users in its short run-time.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>Echo was a relatively simple program written in AutoHotkey Version 2 (AHKV2). 
                    The program checked for private messages (PMs), and if one were found, it opened 
                    the messages and read both the sender's username and message. Echo took this 
                    information and sent it to the ChatGPT API, then awaited a response. When Echo 
                    received a response, it read out the message in the game's open chat and logged 
                    both the message and the response.
                </p><p>
                    Echo also had a few features, such as command detection. If a player attempted to 
                    force the bot to use an in-game command, it would detect and drop the messageâ€”except 
                    for Graal Online Classic's built-in Rock-Paper-Scissors minigame. Echo could play 
                    this game with players by choosing a random number that would determine their choice 
                    of rock, paper, or scissors.
                </p><p>
                    During the first few days, as the bot was running, I made hotfixes as issues arose, 
                    leading to a small group of people believing the bot was fake. It would occasionally 
                    double-type a letter or miss one in the first two days. This was caused by using 
                    Firefox as my browser initially; Firefox has a delay on Graal Online Classic and does 
                    not allow the paste feature. I was making the bot write out each letter one after 
                    the other with a delay between them. After learning that Chrome and Chromium-based 
                    browsers allowed for copy-and-paste functionality, I moved to Microsoft Edge. 
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>What Happened</h2>
                <p>
                    The account received a warning from the Graal Online Classic administration staff 
                    simply saying "No," and I immediately ceased using the program. After double-checking 
                    the Graal Online Code of Conduct, I emailed the staff to ask for more context, as, 
                    from my understanding, I was within the guidelines. I received an email stating, 
                    "Any program used to operate an account in place of a person is prohibited." I attempted 
                    to have a conversation but have yet to receive any messages in return, even after 
                    several follow-up emails.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    I would have liked to continue this project, as seeing how players interacted 
                    with the bot was a lot of fun. It was cute to see ChatGPT recognize recurring 
                    players and jokes in the conversations, but, as with anything on the internet, 
                    there were some less-than-appropriate messages. While there was an attempt to 
                    curate ChatGPT, sometimes it would respond to less desirable messages. Echo 
                    still needed some work before it could be fully autonomous. Now and then, it 
                    would get stuck, and I'd have to restart the program. I had also considered 
                    switching to Ollama for several reasons, namely cost, as Ollama could be 
                    self-hosted.
                </p><p>
                    Ultimately, Echo was cut too short, but the experience was delightful, 
                    and I'm glad I did it. It was by far my most popular project.
