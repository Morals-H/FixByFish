                    <p>
                        Fish & Friends is one of the final active server for the now abandoned 
                        game Nether Resurrected. The server originally began operation on December 
                        24, 2023. This servers is one of the two last remaining communities for the 
                        game’s staggeringly low remaining player base. Of the two remaining 
                        communities the server AusAntiHeros provides the player base with a 
                        vanilla experience with a server based out of Australia, meanwhile my 
                        server provides a modded experience based out of the eastern United States. 
                        For the current population I feel this is a solid arrangement. 
                        <br><br>
                        My server is fairly heavily modded, with a completely reworked economy 
                        that speeds up progression while also attempting to encourage crafting 
                        for high level equipment. I have enabled the third person view aswell, 
                        which really makes the game feel different ontop of everything else. 
                        The game difficulty on my server is double the default, and while there 
                        is little information on what this actually does I believe this causes 
                        the Nether on my server have an increased spawn rate, and behave in an 
                        overall more agressive manner. My server also features decreased gravity, 
                        while a bit floaty I personally believe this makes escaping nether a lot 
                        more interesting and dynamic. Last but not least, the gamespeed is 
                        slightly increased. 
                        <br><br>
                        Since its original inception, my server has been up and down a few times, 
                        but I believe its now up to stay. From the start it has seen 381 unique 
                        players, but at this point you're lucky if you find even one other person 
                        on at the same time. I'd love to see it more active, but that is simply 
                        not going to happen. The original developers have wiped their hands of it, 
                        even removing the Discord channel from their server. The company that 
                        purchased the IP, were content to simply let it die aswell.  
                        <br><br>
                        I've been asked if I'll ever stop hosting my server, and truthfully I don't 
                        think so. So long as I'm still alive, and even one person is interested in 
                        coming back for a revisit I will try to maintain it. 
                        <br><br>
                        I wanna give a special thanks to the players who've joined my Discord 
                        server, and played Nether with me:
                        Dead X_X Jester, Dalm, Mattos, Sheeplie, Cultist, OPX Sanji, & DirtyMichy.
                        <br><br>
                        Thanks guys.
