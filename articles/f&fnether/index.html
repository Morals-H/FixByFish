                    <p>
                        Fish & Friends was, at the time, the final active server for the now-abandoned Nether Resurrected. The server operated from December 24, 2023, to August 20, 2024, serving as one of the last organized communities within the game’s remaining player base.

                        <p>
                            The server introduced a fully reworked economy designed to give items tangible value. Loot runs were structured so that selling excess items typically covered essential expenses such as ammunition and medication, leaving only a small profit margin. This encouraged thoughtful resource management rather than accumulation.

                        <p>
                            Enemy behavior was also significantly adjusted. Hostile NPCs had increased health, improved awareness, higher damage output, and elevated spawn rates. Many weapons, clothing items, and equipment pieces were removed from store purchase availability, shifting progression toward crafting and scavenging.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over its lifetime, the server recorded 323 unique players, averaging approximately 52 unique players per month. Sixteen players reached the maximum level, while the average player level remained at four, highlighting the server’s increased difficulty curve.

                            The server did not close due to a single defining event. As additional servers appeared and the remaining player base became further distributed, continued hosting was no longer necessary. The infrastructure remains restorable should interest return in the future.

                    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nether Resurrected demonstrated strong foundational potential, but development momentum stalled over time. Current ownership has shown limited interest in further expansion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite this, the community built around the project remains meaningful, with continued discussion and engagement occurring on external platforms such as Steam discussion boards.
