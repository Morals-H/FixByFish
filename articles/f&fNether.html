                <h2>Project</h2>
                <p>Fish & Friends was, at the time, the last server for the now-abandoned Nether Resurrected. Fish & Friends ran from December 24, 2023, to August 20, 2024.
                    <p>

                        <h2>Technical Side</h2>
                        <p>Fish & Friends had an entirely reworked economy from the base game to give items more value. The core concept behind the reworks was giving items real value; if you completed a loot run and sold your excess items, you'd find you had enough money to cover medication and ammo but only had a small amount left over. Nothing was overpriced; generally, to get a mid-tier gun, you'd only have to do four or five loot runs if you were careful.
                        </p>
                        <p>In Fish & Friends, Enemies had more health, were generally more aware, did more damage, and had significantly higher spawn rates. Many items, clothing, and weapons could not be purchased from the store and the ones that could be expensive to push crafting and scavenging heavily.
                        </p>
                        <p>In its lifetime, the server saw 323 unique players, averaging 52 unique players a month. Sixteen players reached the maximum level, but the average player level was only four.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What Happened</h2>
                        <p>No event happened that caused me to stop hosting the server; there wasn't a need for it anymore. Several other servers had popped back up, and with the tiny community that still plays Nether Resurrected, it just wasn't worth having around. If it is ever needed again, I'll gladly back the server up so the community can have a place to play together.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                        <p>Nether was a decent game with great potential, and it's sad to see it on its deathbed. The current owners at Fredaikis have no interest in the IP and have left it to rot.
                        </p>
                        <p>With that said, I love this game and the community, so I will continue to be active on the Steam discussion board, but I have no hope of seeing anything else from this property.
