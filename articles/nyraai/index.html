                <h2>Project</h2>
                <p>
                    Echo AI was a project that aimed to allow players in the MMO Graal Online 
                    Classic to communicate fully with OpenAI's ChatGPT within the game. Echo 
                    only ran from July 23 to July 28, 2024, before the Graal Administration Staff 
                    shut it down. Echo accumulated thousands of messages from hundreds of unique 
                    users in its short run-time. Nyra was me revisiting the project and making
                    massive improvements to it. In this test run the project was known as Nyra. 
                    Nyra ran off and on from April 25, 2025 to May 22, 2025, before the Graal Administration Staff
                    shut it down by banning the Nyra account, the Echo account, and my main account.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p> 
                    Nyra was fairly similar to her sister in how she operated, however version
                    two was completely remade from the ground up in Python. Nyra was programmed
                    to check for messages, read any if available, send the data to a locally hosted
                    model of the Qwen 2 LLM, await a response, and then respond to the message in 
                    Graal Online Classic's public chat using the response it received. 
                </p><p>
                    Nyra had all the same features as Echo did with a few additions, such as command detection. 
                    If a player attempted to force the bot to use an in-game command, it would detect and drop 
                    the message—except for Graal Online Classic's built-in dance feature, private messaging system, and 
                    Rock-Paper-Scissors minigame.
                </p><p>
                    Nyra also included a message filtering system designed to scan both incoming and outgoing messages for 
                    potentially harmful or inappropriate content. This feature aimed to automatically detect and block 
                    profanity, hate speech, or any other form of communication that violated the community guidelines or 
                    posed a threat to user safety. Despite these precautions, the filtering system was not foolproof—certain 
                    harmful messages were still able to bypass the filters due to limitations in detection accuracy or users 
                    finding ways to circumvent the system. As a result, some flagged accounts continued to engage in behavior 
                    that ultimately led to their suspension or permanent bans by the moderation team.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>What Happened</h2>
                <p>
                    The account operated steadily for quite some time, maintaining a relatively low profile aside from the 
                    occasional chat reset or being manually relocated by the administration team. Throughout this period, 
                    I remained proactive in monitoring the message logs, carefully reviewing conversations to identify any 
                    inappropriate language or terms that had managed to slip past the filters. Whenever I discovered such 
                    instances, I would immediately update the blacklist to tighten the filtering system and prevent repeat offenses.
                </p><p>
                    Despite these efforts to uphold a clean and respectful environment, the situation took a turn when a player 
                    deliberately used Nyra to harass others within the game. This behavior was quickly reported by the affected 
                    players, drawing direct attention from the game's moderation team. Unfortunately, due to the severity of the
                    incident and the nature of the reports, the account was permanently banned, marking the end of Nyra’s 
                    operation within that environment.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Nyra, and Echo before her were both amazing projects, and I have genuinely not had as much
                    fun on any other project as I had with them. I'm interested in continuing to do more AI retrofitting, 
                    but maybe not just in the world of Graal. It was unfortunate how people used her to put others down, but 
                    I will strive to make improvements in the future.
