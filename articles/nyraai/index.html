                    Nyra AI was a major overhaul of my earlier project, Echo AI, featuring significant improvements in functionality, stability, and scope. This enhanced version operated under the name “Nyra” during its testing phase. The bot was active intermittently from April 25, 2025, to May 22, 2025, demonstrating more advanced behavior and broader capabilities than its predecessor.

                    <p>
                        While Nyra shared the same core concept as Echo, it was entirely rebuilt from the ground up in Python. The bot was designed to monitor in-game messages, read them in real time, and forward the text to a locally hosted instance of the Qwen 2 large language model (LLM). Once a response was generated, Nyra would post it publicly in Graal Online Classic's chat, enabling conversational AI interaction within the game environment.

                        In addition to Echo's original features, Nyra introduced further command detection. If a user attempted to issue an in-game command via chat, Nyra could identify and suppress it except for commands related to the game's built-in dance emotes, private messaging, and the Rock-Paper-Scissors minigame.
                    </p> <p>
                        Nyra also included a custom message filtering system that scanned both incoming and outgoing messages for harmful or inappropriate content. This filter was built to identify and block profanity, hate speech, and other rule-violating communication. However, no system is perfect—some content still slipped through due to evasion techniques and detection limitations. These edge cases occasionally led to users abusing the system, despite ongoing updates to the blacklist.

                    <p>
                        Nyra operated without major incident for a while. Occasionally, the bot experienced chat resets or was manually moved by administrators, but nothing that raised serious flags. During this period, I regularly monitored logs and updated the filtering system to patch any loopholes or overlooked keywords.
                    </p><p>
                        Unfortunately, a user deliberately used Nyra to harass other players. This behavior was quickly reported to the Graal Online moderation team. Despite the improvements in content filtering and moderation, the incident resulted in the administration team taking action. The Nyra account, the older Echo account, and my personal main account were all hit with a temporary ban.

                    Both Nyra and Echo were incredibly rewarding projects for me. I haven’t had as much fun working on any other personal project, and the experience deepened my passion for AI integration in unconventional spaces. While it's unfortunate that the tool was misused, the lessons I learned were invaluable. I remain excited about exploring future AI retrofitting—though likely outside of Graal—and will continue striving to make smarter, safer systems moving forward.
