                    <p>
                        Nyra AI was a major overhaul of Echo AI, introducing significant improvements in functionality, stability, and scope. Operating under the name “Nyra” during its testing phase, the bot was active from April 25, 2025, to May 22, 2025, demonstrating advanced behavior and broader capabilities than its predecessor.

                    <h2>Technical Details</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Built entirely in Python, Nyra monitored in-game messages in real time and forwarded text to a locally hosted Qwen 2 LLM. Responses were posted publicly in Graal Online Classic’s chat, enabling conversational AI interaction within the game.

                        <p>
                            Nyra enhanced command detection beyond Echo AI, filtering in-game commands except for dance emotes, private messages, and the Rock-Paper-Scissors minigame. A custom message filter blocked profanity, hate speech, and other inappropriate content, though some edge cases occasionally bypassed the system.

                    <h2>Project Findings</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Nyra operated without major incident for the most part, with occasional chat resets or manual moves by administrators. Logs were regularly monitored and filters updated to close any loopholes.

                        <p>
                            A user eventually misused Nyra to harass others. Despite the advanced filtering, this led to the Graal Online moderation team temporarily banning the Nyra account, the older Echo account, and my personal main account.

                    <h2>Closing Notes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Both Nyra and Echo were highly rewarding projects, deepening my passion for AI integration in unconventional spaces. While misuse was unfortunate, the lessons learned were invaluable. Future AI projects will focus on smarter, safer systems, likely outside of Graal.
