                    <p>
                        Ink & Yuki is a cooperative 3D collectathon published on June 15, 2022, created during a two-week Game Jam known as Meow Jam. The game features a monochrome art style within a fully 3D space. Inspired by classic cartoons and a desire to stand out in a crowded jam environment, the minimalist aesthetic gives the world and characters a distinctive, lively charm.

                            The project was built using Unity, Visual Studio, Krita, and Blender. Unity handled core mechanics, physics, and prefabs, allowing rapid iteration within the limited development window. Blender was used to prototype 3D models that aligned with the stylized art direction, while Krita contributed hand-drawn textures for select assets.

                            Developing a 3D cooperative experience within two weeks presented significant scope challenges. Relying heavily on Unity’s built-in systems helped maintain stability and performance while keeping production manageable.

                            At one point, discussions began with a publisher interested in expanding the project. However, the required turnaround timeline exceeded what the small team could reasonably support. Choosing not to rush development preserved the integrity of the original vision.

                            Since release, the game has remained largely unchanged, though the possibility of expanding its mechanics or introducing narrative elements has been explored independently.

                    <p>
                        Ink & Yuki remains a deeply meaningful project. While attempts have been made to revisit it, recreating the creative spark of that focused two-week development period has proven difficult. As it stands, it remains one of the most personally cherished projects.
