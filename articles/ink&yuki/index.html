                <h2>Project</h2>
                <p>Ink & Yuki is a cooperative collectathon game published on June 15, 2022, made for a two-week Game Jam called Meow Jam.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>Ink & Yuki was made in Unity, and utilized Photon Pun 2 hosting for the multiplayer servers.</p>
                <p>The art was entirely made from scratch because I wanted something entirely unique, and I think I achieved my goal. The game is monochrome in a 3D space with cute cartoony visuals. I had many challenges in making the game visually readable; some of my solutions can be seen with the outlines, the distance particles, and the landing shadow.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>What Happened</h2>
                <p>At one point, we were in talks with a publisher, but they needed a much quicker turnout than my team could handle, so we had to decline. Since then, nothing has happened with the game.</p>
                <br>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>Ink & Yuki is a project I look back on very fondly. I've been interested in continuing it since, but I failed at producing anything as special as I did in the first two weeks. It might be something I revisit in the future, but as it stands, it's among my favorite projects and has a special place in my heart.</p>
                <p>The game is playable <a href="https://shawnwolf.itch.io/ink-yuki">here</a>, a short demo with a lot of jankyness.</p>
