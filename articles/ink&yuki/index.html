                <p>
                    Ink & Yuki is a cooperative collectathon game published on June 15, 2022, 
                    made for a two-week Game Jam called Meow Jam. The game features a unique 
                    art style, that being monochrome, in a 3D space. This choice was inspired 
                    by classic cartoons and the desire to stand out in a crowded jam. Despite 
                    its minimalist look, the art style added depth to the world and character 
                    designs, making it feel alive and distinctive.

                <h2>Technical</h2>
                <p>
                    Ink & Yuki was entirely made with Unity, Visual Studio, Krita, and Blender. 
                    Unity handled all the game mechanics and physics, while Krita was essentially 
                    only used to create the hand-drawn textures on about two models. Blender 
                    allowed me to prototype 3D models that fit the art style quickly. I leaned 
                    heavily on Unity's built-in features to save time, such as the physics and 
                    prefab systems, ensuring that the game ran smoothly despite the time constraints. 
                    Developing a 3D game in two weeks was a significant challenge, but these tools 
                    made it manageable.

                <h2>What Happened</h2>
                <p>
                    We were in talks with a publisher at one point, but they needed a much quicker 
                    turnout than my very small team at the time could handle, so we had to decline. 
                    This decision was difficult, as it could have brought Ink & Yuki to a larger 
                    audience. However, it was my baby, and I believed rushing the project would 
                    compromise the quality of the work. Since then, the game has remained the same, 
                    though I've revisited it independently, perhaps expanding on the existing 
                    mechanics or introducing a narrative.

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Ink & Yuki is a project I look back on very fondly. While I've been interested in 
                    continuing it, I struggled to produce anything as special as what I achieved in 
                    those two weeks. It might be something I revisit in the future, but as it stands, 
                    it's among my favorite projects and has a special place in my heart.
