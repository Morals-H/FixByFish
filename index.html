                    <p>
                        Hi, I'm [Fish], an electronics technician based out of Ohio, with experience
                        in 3D design, programming, and electronics engineering.
                        Congratulations on finding my little ongoing project, 
                        I appreciate any and all interest in my work. Here you can read about my
                        projects, interests, and whatever else I plan on talking about. 
                        A bit of a content warning, as this is my personal website all my thoughts
                        and concerns are unfiltered. You get me, nothing more nothing less.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section id="why" class="content-block">
                    <h2>Why</h2>
                    <p>
                        I hate almost the entirety of social media, and truthfully, 
                        what the internet has shifted towards as a whole. Essentially, 
                        all major platforms are like slot machines, flashing lights, 
                        and ringing bells to keep you in line. If you so much as look 
                        away for a minute, these platforms adjust their algorithms to 
                        fine-tune the content for you as a person. When it comes to the 
                        content they push, some of it is to make you mad, some is to 
                        make you sad, and some is to make you laugh. The reason they do 
                        this is that they want a rise out of you. An emotional person is 
                        an engaged person. 

                        These companies have no qualms about damaging your attention span 
                        and breaching your privacy as an individual. Therefore, I have no 
                        qualms with doing my part to create distance for myself and advocating 
                        for others to do the same. <b>FUCK</b> Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, 
                        Flock, and every other company that seeks to deanonomise private citizens. 
                        There are so many excellent alternatives that value your privacy as an 
                        individual, and I want to talk about them all.
