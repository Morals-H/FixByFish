                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Shawn, a technician based in Cleveland, Ohio. This is my personal website for sharing projects and interests.
                    Expect posts about projects ranging from programming, electronic repair & modifications, 3D printing, 
                    2D artwork, and whatever other sidequests I find myself taking part in.

                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Why make a website?</h2>
                <p>
                    I like making and sharing my projects, but I don't like the current state of social media. 
                    This site is my nerdy little corner of the internet where I can share until my heart's 
                    content while avoiding the toxic communities of mainstream social media or the addictive 
                    cycle of posting for engagement. If people find my site interesting, it's perfect, but this 
                    is more for me than anyone else.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2>Why the name?</h2>
                <p>
                    It's pretty simple. I use the username Fish on most websites, and I like to fix stuff ~so Fix 
                    By Fish. Repairing electronics is only a portion of the content I want to post here.
